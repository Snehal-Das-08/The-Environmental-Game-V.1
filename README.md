This is a project involving a game that raises awareness for people about waste disposal and recycling through the use of python tkinter to create fun and interactive UI.
This project was made and tested in Visual Studio Code and this is the latest version.
In order to run this code, there is a file called main.py which you can run, but the code will also need access to the images in the repository.
